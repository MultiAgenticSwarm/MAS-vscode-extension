- Webview HTML: `/home/umair/Desktop/MAS-vscode-extension/media/webview.html`

### Demo Timing
- Total demo length: ~5-6 minutes
- Core collaboration sequence: ~3 minutes
- Setup and conclusion: ~2-3 minutes

### Recording Tips
1. **Screen Resolution**: Use 1920x1080 or higher
2. **VS Code Theme**: Use a clean, professional theme
3. **Font Size**: Increase font size for better visibility
4. **Mouse Highlighting**: Enable mouse click indicators
5. **Audio**: Clear narration with background music (optional)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Demo Doesn't Work
1. **Extension Not Loading**: Restart VS Code, check developer console

3. **Chat Not Responding**: Check browser developer tools for JavaScript errors
4. **Python App Fails**: Ensure Python 3.7+ and pip are installed

### Backup Plan
If technical issues occur during demo:
1. Have screenshots/video of expected behavior ready
2. Pre-record the agent collaboration sequence
3. Have the completed todo app files ready to show
