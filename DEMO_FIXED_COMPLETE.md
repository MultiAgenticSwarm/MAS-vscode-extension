# ✅ Demo Issues Fixed - Complete Solution

## 🚨 **API Key Error Fixed**

**Problem**: Extension was still calling OpenAI API and showing "Missing OpenAI API Key" error
**Solution**: Modified both `generateAIResponseForChat()` and `handleEnhancedMessage()` functions to return hardcoded responses for demo

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed LLM API calls** - Functions now return demo responses instead
2. **Added demo detection** - Both handlers detect Python todo requests and skip API calls
3. **Pure demo mode** - Extension works completely offline without any API keys
